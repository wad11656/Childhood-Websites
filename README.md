# Childhood-Websites
Links to archive.org's preservations of a couple websites I made as a kid. I wish I knew about archive.org back then to preserve all the pages! Those really were the days! Before having to worry about your appearances and your place in the dating pool... Just letting your creative juices run wild, making internet friends, involving IRL friends with it, developing new skills, having fun.

### Cheese Worlds:

 - I got my IRL church friends really involved with this.
    - I remember some even made art for me (filed under the "Quadrant 2" link), alongside poems and stories, but unfortunately all those things were lost.
 - I dubbed myself the Cheese King. My (incredibly mean) "friend" Mason was the Chocolate Lord, and my (incredibly nice) friend Matt was the Time Master.
    - The other celestial bodies (Strawberry Nebula, Sausage Planet, Waffle Planet, Bacon Nebula) also all had leaders that were kids from my church.
 - When I went to Mason's house (he was wealthy, had a big clean house and it was an overall awesome place to hang out an play video games), we sometimes had Cheese Lord vs. Chocolate Lord battles while bouncing on the trampoline, fighting each other in epic Star Wars-like fashion with lightsabers.
 - I helped Mason make his own spin-off site at https://web.archive.org/web/20061125020059/http://www.freewebs.com/masonstories/ where he wrote some lengthy stories about his battles as the Chocolate Lord, but unfortunately they weren't preserved.

### Awesome Kids Pokémon:

- Isn't that static blue theme so simple and beautiful?? Makes me yearn for the days of simple static website design.
   - ALSO THE CUSTOM WEB CURSORS, WHICH ARE SERENDIPITOUSLY STILL FUNCTIONAL! UGH! *NOBODY* uses those anymore! WHY?? I've totally forgotten how cool the Internet used to be.
- Where I met my primary internet friend and artist, SpookyPatrol.  
   - We actually found each other in the "Chatroom" link on this very website of mine! That's pretty impressive that we were both on my relatively obscure Pokémon website and were in my website's chatroom at the same time, and that we got along so well.
   - I also had her make the "Diamond and Pearl Version" art in the top-left area, which art got updated once in a while. Wasn't she a talented artist at the age of a young teen??
   
### Awesome Kids Pokémon v2.0:
https://web.archive.org/web/20100212003507/freewebs.com/akpokemonol
- My first website where I edited actual web files manually—not using any sort of website builder like the first two FreeWebs sites listed above. (And AI wasn't even a topic of serious conversation back then of course--for making websites or anything else.)
- I am impressed with my childhood self! Looking at the grammar and fun design, I can see I always had a passion for trying to make things look fun and engaging with eye-catching content and organization.
- I remeber my favorite part of this site was the [Requested Sprites](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625214207/http://www.freewebs.com/akpokemonol/Images%20and%20Sprites/Sprites/RequestedSprites.htm) collection. At the time of archival, I apparently had collected 67(!) pieces of free commissioned Pokémon pixel art. Unfortunately, none of the links on that page are active, but some of the artwork is archived on the old site [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100922051957/http://akpokemon.webs.com/imagesandsprites.htm).
   - For some reason, on the [Serebii.net forums](https://forums.serebii.net/)—and in the Pokémon internet community in general—pixel art was a hot topic, and there were a surprising number of great artists.

### Special Mention: Pokémon Egg Move Breeding Guide:
- I don't remember the URL, or it wasn't archived.
- I started building out another FreeWebs site that would outline the exact Pokkémon in the video games that need to breed in order for their offspring to acquire certain "egg moves". I used the same website builder theme as the blue one in the original "Awesome Kids Pokémon" website above, but in yellow.
- I was super proud of the progress I was making in making the site look good, and manually looking up and mapping out every single breeding combination possible/necessary to get the offspring certain egg moves.
- A pretty crazy story related to this... Unfortunately, in the middle of creating the website, Serebii Joe announced there was a big new feature coming to Serebii.net. With the way he phrased the announcement, my heart sank. For some reason I immediately knew that it was an egg move breeding guide. I hopped on the Serebii.net ICQ chat, and randomly just typed the message "I really hope the new Serebii.net feature isn't an egg move breeding guide." Serebii Joe, who from what I could tell wasn't participating in the current conversation at all, actually responded "Why?" And I explained that I had been building a website for it and all my effort would be wasted. Lo and behold, the new Egg Move feature was announced soon afterward.
